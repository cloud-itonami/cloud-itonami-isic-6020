  "Phase 0->3 staged rollout for the ISIC-6020 television programming
  and broadcasting operations-coordination actor.

    Phase 0  read-only            -- no writes, still governor-gated.
    Phase 1  assisted-logging     -- broadcast-record logging allowed,
                                     every write needs human approval.
    Phase 2  assisted-coordination-- adds programming-block scheduling,
                                     equipment-maintenance coordination
                                     proposals, still approval.
    Phase 3  supervised auto      -- governor-clean, high-confidence
                                     `:log-broadcast-record`/
                                     `:schedule-broadcast-operation`/
                                     `:coordinate-equipment-maintenance`
                                     may auto-commit.
                                     `:flag-content-concern` NEVER
                                     auto-commits, at any phase.

  `:flag-content-concern` is deliberately ABSENT from every phase's
  `:auto` set, including phase 3 -- a permanent structural fact, not a
  rollout milestone still to come. Flagging an FCC-compliance/on-air-
  incident/emergency-alert concern always needs a human to actually
  look at it. `tvbroadcastops.governor`'s own `always-escalate-ops`
  enforces the same invariant independently -- two layers, not one,
  agree on this."
